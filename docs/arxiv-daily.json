This paper benchmarks three retrieval pipelines on Java codebases (Shopizer, with additional runs on ThingsBoard and OpenMRS Core): (A) vector-only No-Graph RAG, (B) an LLM-generated knowledge graph RAG (LLM-KB), and (C) a deterministic AST-derived knowledge graph RAG (DKB) built with Tree-sitter and bidirectional traversal.   Using 15 architecture and code-tracing queries per repository, we measure indexing time, query latency, corpus coverage, cost, and answer correctness. DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases. Query latency is similar for No-Graph and DKB, while LLM-KB is slower and more variable. On the Shopizer question suite, DKB achieves the highest correctness, LLM-KB is close behind, and the vector-only baseline performs worst on upstream architectural queries and has the highest hallucination risk. Overall, deterministic AST-derived graphs provide more reliable coverage and multi-hop grounding than LLM-extracted graphs at substantially lower indexing cost.</details>|[2601.08773v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08773v1)| null|",

Traditional reference-based metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture the functional utility of spatial directives, specifically whether an instruction successfully guides a navigator to the intended destination. Although existing VLN agents could serve as evaluators, their reliance on high-fidelity visual simulators introduces licensing constraints and computational costs, and perception errors further confound linguistic quality assessment. This paper introduces GROKE(Graph-based Reasoning over OSM Knowledge for instruction Evaluation), a vision-free training-free hierarchical LLM-based framework for evaluating navigation instructions using OpenStreetMap data. Through systematic ablation studies, we demonstrate that structured JSON and textual formats for spatial information substantially outperform grid-based and visual graph representations. Our hierarchical architecture combines sub-instruction planning with topological graph navigation, reducing navigation error by 68.5% compared to heuristic and sampling baselines on the Map2Seq dataset. The agent's execution success, trajectory fidelity, and decision patterns serve as proxy metrics for functional navigability given OSM-visible landmarks and topology, establishing a scalable and interpretable evaluation paradigm without visual dependencies.

However, current GraphRAG methods are constrained by a prevailing \\textit{build-then-reason} paradigm, which relies on a static, pre-constructed Knowledge Graph (KG). This paradigm faces two critical challenges. First, the KG's inherent incompleteness often breaks reasoning paths. Second, the graph's low signal-to-noise ratio introduces distractor facts, presenting query-relevant but misleading knowledge that disrupts the reasoning process.   To address these challenges, we argue for a \\textit{reason-and-construct} paradigm and propose Relink, a framework that dynamically builds a query-specific evidence graph. To tackle incompleteness, \\textbf{Relink} instantiates required facts from a latent relation pool derived from the original text corpus, repairing broken paths on the fly. To handle misleading or distractor facts, Relink employs a unified, query-aware evaluation strategy that jointly considers candidates from both the KG and latent relations, selecting those most useful for answering the query rather than relying on their pre-existence. This empowers Relink to actively discard distractor facts and construct the most faithful and precise evidence path for each query.   Extensive experiments on five Open-Domain Question Answering benchmarks show that Relink achieves significant average improvements of 5.4\\% in EM and 5.2\\% in F1 over leading GraphRAG baselines, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed framework.</details>|[2601.07192v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07192v1)| null|",

Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs. The experimental results demonstrate that CPSR achieves state-of-the-art performance.</details>|[2601.05629v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05629v1)| null|",

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by incorporating external knowledge, conventional single-shot retrieval often fails to resolve complex biomedical queries requiring multi-step inference. To address this, we propose Self-MedRAG, a self-reflective hybrid framework designed to mimic the iterative hypothesis-verification process of clinical reasoning. Self-MedRAG integrates a hybrid retrieval strategy, combining sparse (BM25) and dense (Contriever) retrievers via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to maximize evidence coverage. It employs a generator to produce answers with supporting rationales, which are then assessed by a lightweight self-reflection module using Natural Language Inference (NLI) or LLM-based verification. If the rationale lacks sufficient evidentiary support, the system autonomously reformulates the query and iterates to refine the context. We evaluated Self-MedRAG on the MedQA and PubMedQA benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our hybrid retrieval approach significantly outperforms single-retriever baselines. Furthermore, the inclusion of the self-reflective loop yielded substantial gains, increasing accuracy on MedQA from 80.00% to 83.33% and on PubMedQA from 69.10% to 79.82%. These findings confirm that integrating hybrid retrieval with iterative, evidence-based self-reflection effectively reduces unsupported claims and enhances the clinical reliability of LLM-based systems.</details>|[2601.04531v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04531v1)| null|",

As these KGs often represent an organization's highly valuable intellectual property (IP), they face a significant risk of theft for private use. In this scenario, attackers operate in isolated environments. This private-use threat renders passive defenses like watermarking ineffective, as they require output access for detection. Simultaneously, the low-latency demands of GraphRAG make strong encryption which incurs prohibitive overhead impractical. To address these challenges, we propose AURA, a novel framework based on Data Adulteration designed to make any stolen KG unusable to an adversary. Our framework pre-emptively injects plausible but false adulterants into the KG. For an attacker, these adulterants deteriorate the retrieved context and lead to factually incorrect responses. Conversely, for authorized users, a secret key enables the efficient filtering of all adulterants via encrypted metadata tags before they are passed to the LLM, ensuring query results remain completely accurate. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach: AURA degrades the performance of unauthorized systems to an accuracy of just 5.3%, while maintaining 100% fidelity for authorized users with negligible overhead. Furthermore, AURA proves robust against various sanitization attempts, retaining 80.2% of its adulterants.</details>|[2601.00274v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00274v1)| null|",

However, current RAG approaches focus primarily on performance improvements while overlooking evidence-based medicine (EBM) principles. This study addresses two key gaps: (1) the lack of PICO alignment between queries and retrieved evidence, and (2) the absence of evidence hierarchy considerations during reranking. We present a generalizable strategy for adapting EBM to graph-based RAG, integrating the PICO framework into knowledge graph construction and retrieval, and proposing a Bayesian-inspired reranking algorithm to calibrate ranking scores by evidence grade without introducing predefined weights. We validated this framework in sports rehabilitation, a literature-rich domain currently lacking RAG systems and benchmarks. We released a knowledge graph (357,844 nodes and 371,226 edges) and a reusable benchmark of 1,637 QA pairs. The system achieved 0.830 nugget coverage, 0.819 answer faithfulness, 0.882 semantic similarity, and 0.788 PICOT match accuracy. In a 5-point Likert evaluation, five expert clinicians rated the system 4.66-4.84 across factual accuracy, faithfulness, relevance, safety, and PICO alignment. These findings demonstrate that the proposed EBM adaptation strategy improves retrieval and answer quality and is transferable to other clinical domains. The released resources also help address the scarcity of RAG datasets in sports rehabilitation.</details>|[2601.00216v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00216v1)| null|",

Despite recent progress, existing TKG reasoning models typically rely on large parameter sizes and intensive computation, leading to high hardware costs and energy consumption. These constraints hinder their deployment on resource-constrained, low-power, and distributed platforms that require real-time inference. Moreover, most existing model compression and distillation techniques are designed for static knowledge graphs and fail to adequately capture the temporal dependencies inherent in TKGs, often resulting in degraded reasoning performance. To address these challenges, we propose a distillation framework specifically tailored for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Our approach leverages large language models as teacher models to guide the distillation process, enabling effective transfer of both structural and temporal reasoning capabilities to lightweight student models. By integrating large-scale public knowledge with task-specific temporal information, the proposed framework enhances the student model's ability to model temporal dynamics while maintaining a compact and efficient architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving a favorable trade-off between reasoning accuracy, computational efficiency, and practical deployability.</details>|[2601.00202v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00202v1)| null|",

Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting.

Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge.

Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation.

However, as organized crime groups are becoming more professional in real-world scenarios, fraudsters are employing more sophisticated camouflage strategies. Specifically, fraudsters disguise themselves by mimicking the behavioral data collected by platforms, ensuring that their key characteristics are consistent with those of benign users to a high degree, which we call Adaptive Camouflage. Consequently, this narrows the differences in behavioral traits between them and benign users within the platform's database, thereby making current GFD models lose efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a relation diffusion-based graph augmentation model Grad. In detail, Grad leverages a supervised graph contrastive learning module to enhance the fraud-benign difference and employs a guided relation diffusion generator to generate auxiliary homophilic relations from scratch. Based on these, weak fraudulent signals would be enhanced during the aggregation process, thus being obvious enough to be captured. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets provided by WeChat Pay, one of the largest online payment platforms with billions of users, and three public datasets.

This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths.

Depending on the temporal position of the query, the task is categorized into interpolation and extrapolation. Existing interpolation methods typically embed temporal information into individual facts to complete missing historical knowledge, while extrapolation techniques often leverage sequence models over graph snapshots to identify recurring patterns for future event prediction. These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context. For extrapolation, it applies a conditional diffusion process, which forces the model to learn underlying evolutionary principles rather than just superficial patterns, enhancing its ability to predict unseen future events. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show DynaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Sparse KG reasoning, the task of inferring missing knowledge over sparse KGs, is inherently challenging due to the scarcity of knowledge and the difficulty of capturing relational patterns in sparse scenarios. Among all sparse KG reasoning methods, path-based ones have attracted plenty of attention due to their interpretability. Existing path-based methods typically rely on computationally intensive random walks to collect paths, producing paths of variable quality. Additionally, these methods fail to leverage the structured nature of graphs by treating paths independently. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Structural and Probabilistic framework named StruProKGR, tailored for efficient and interpretable reasoning on sparse KGs. StruProKGR utilizes a distance-guided path collection mechanism to significantly reduce computational costs while exploring more relevant paths. It further enhances the reasoning process by incorporating structural information through probabilistic path aggregation, which prioritizes paths that reinforce each other.

As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness.

However, LLM hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect citations to source code, remains a critical barrier to reliable developer assistance. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving verifiable, citation grounded code comprehension through hybrid retrieval and lightweight structural reasoning. Our work is grounded in systematic evaluation across 30 Python repositories with 180 developer queries, comparing retrieval modalities, graph expansion strategies, and citation verification mechanisms. We find that challenges of citation accuracy arise from the interplay between sparse lexical matching, dense semantic similarity, and cross file architectural dependencies. Among these, cross file evidence discovery is the largest contributor to citation completeness, but it is largely overlooked because existing systems rely on pure textual similarity without leveraging code structure. We advocate for citation grounded generation as an architectural principle for code comprehension systems and demonstrate this need by achieving 92 percent citation accuracy with zero hallucinations. Specifically, we develop a hybrid retrieval system combining BM25 sparse matching, BGE dense embeddings, and Neo4j graph expansion via import relationships, which outperforms single mode baselines by 14 to 18 percentage points while discovering cross file evidence missed by pure text similarity in 62 percent of architectural queries.</details>|[2512.12117v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12117v1)| null|",

A central challenge in this setting is question answering, which requires jointly leveraging unstructured text and the structured relational signals within the graph. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advances in natural language understanding, their direct use for reasoning over text-attributed graphs remains limited. Retrieval-augmented generation methods that operate purely on text often treat passages as isolated units, ignoring the interconnected structure of the graph. Conversely, graph-based RAG methods that serialize large subgraphs into long textual sequences quickly become infeasible due to LLM context-length constraints, resulting in fragmented reasoning and degraded accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Graph-O1, an agentic GraphRAG framework that enables LLMs to conduct stepwise, interactive reasoning over graphs. Our approach integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with end-to-end reinforcement learning, allowing the model to selectively explore and retrieve only the most informative subgraph components. The reasoning procedure is framed as a multi-turn interaction between the agent and the graph environment, and the agent is trained through a unified reward mechanism. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones demonstrate that Graph-O1 consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing answers that are more accurate, reliable, and interpretable.</details>|[2512.17912v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17912v1)| null|",

However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a \"Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason\" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.</details>|[2511.14256v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14256v2)| null|",

Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis; and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions, SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy. On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.</details>|[2511.04838v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04838v1)| null|",

We present a hybrid legal QA agent tailored for judicial settings that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-model ensembling to deliver reliable, auditable, and continuously updatable counsel.

High-quality outputs then undergo human review before being written back to the repository, enabling dynamic knowledge evolution and provenance tracking.

Recently, since real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG) completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue, we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL) method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics.</details>|[2510.16601v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16601v2)| null|",

However, traditional RAG methods rely on fragment-level retrieval, limiting their ability to address query-focused summarization queries. GraphRAG introduces a graph-based paradigm for global knowledge reasoning, yet suffers from inefficiencies in information extraction, costly resource consumption, and poor adaptability to incremental updates. To overcome these limitations, we propose TagRAG, a tag-guided hierarchical knowledge graph RAG framework designed for efficient global reasoning and scalable graph maintenance. TagRAG introduces two key components: (1) Tag Knowledge Graph Construction, which extracts object tags and their relationships from documents and organizes them into hierarchical domain tag chains for structured knowledge representation, and (2) Tag-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which retrieves domain-centric tag chains to localize and synthesize relevant knowledge during inference. This design significantly adapts to smaller language models, improves retrieval granularity, and supports efficient knowledge increment. Extensive experiments on UltraDomain datasets spanning Agriculture, Computer Science, Law, and cross-domain settings demonstrate that TagRAG achieves an average winning rate of 78.36% against baselines while maintaining about 14.6x construction and 1.9x retrieval efficiency compared with GraphRAG.</details>|[2601.05254v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05254v2)| null|",

However, the accuracy of such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency.

Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However, existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time, enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse. Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by up to 24.0%.

Existing studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However, the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context, leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically, we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain.

While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures, enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.

The prevailing paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn, adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors, enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.</details>|[2510.08966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08966v1)| null|",

Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities, is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval, which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood. We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG, analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions.

Existing MMKGC methods follow two multi-modal paradigms: fusion-based and ensemble-based. Fusion-based methods employ fixed fusion strategies, which inevitably leads to the loss of modality-specific information and a lack of flexibility to adapt to varying modality relevance across contexts.

Static k-hop expansions and \"think-longer\" prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack, what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices, allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline (GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth.

Existing pipelines capture only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability. Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations, and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context. Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated by a pretrained GNN and schema-based rule check, enabling process-level supervision without explicit labels.

Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations, with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space, neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying movement network, e.g., road or transit networks.   The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings that reflect the spatial layout of the road network.   A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations.   To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that emphasizes high-confidence deviations.   Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware anomaly detection.</details>|[2509.18386v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18386v1)| null|",

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as novel aids for information retrieval during learning. While LLMs are effective for general-purpose question-answering, they typically lack alignment with the domain knowledge of specific course materials such as textbooks and slides. We investigate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, a knowledge graph-enhanced RAG approach, for page-level question answering in an undergraduate mathematics textbook. While RAG has been effective for retrieving discrete, contextually relevant passages, GraphRAG may excel in modeling interconnected concepts and hierarchical knowledge structures. We curate a dataset of 477 question-answer pairs, each tied to a distinct textbook page. We then compare the standard embedding-based RAG methods to GraphRAG for evaluating both retrieval accuracy-whether the correct page is retrieved-and generated answer quality via F1 scores. Our findings show that embedding-based RAG achieves higher retrieval accuracy and better F1 scores compared to GraphRAG, which tends to retrieve excessive and sometimes irrelevant content due to its entity-based structure. We also explored re-ranking the retrieved pages with LLM and observed mixed results, including performance drop and hallucinations when dealing with larger context windows.

Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank (MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset, different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized score ($M_i \\in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.</details>|[2508.15357v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15357v1)| null|",

However, current works treat different tools as isolated components and fail to leverage the inherent dependencies of tools, leading to invalid planning results. Since tool dependencies are often incomplete, it becomes challenging for LLMs to accurately identify the appropriate tools required by a user request, especially when confronted with a large toolset. To solve this challenge, we propose \\texttt{GTool}, which is the first work aiming to enhance the tool planning ability of LLMs under incomplete dependencies. \\texttt{GTool} constructs a request-specific tool graph to select tools efficiently and generate the \\texttt{<graph token>} which provides sufficient dependency information understandable by LLMs. Moreover, a missing dependency prediction task is designed to improve the reliability of \\texttt{GTool} with incomplete dependencies.

This can hinder explainability due to overwhelmingly large rule sets. We discover rule contexts (meaningful subsets of rules that work together) from training data and use learned probability distribution (i.e. probabilistic circuits) over these rule contexts to more rapidly achieve performance of the full rule set. Our approach achieves a 70-96% reduction in number of rules used while outperforming baseline by up to 31$\\times$ when using equivalent minimal number of rules and preserves 91% of peak baseline performance even when comparing our minimal rule sets against baseline's full rule sets. We show that our framework is grounded in well-known semantics of probabilistic logic, does not require independence assumptions, and that our tractable inference procedure provides both approximate lower bounds and exact probability of a given query.

Prior methods often build modality-specific item-item semantic graphs from raw modality features and use them as supplementary structures alongside the user-item interaction graph to enhance user preference learning. However, these semantic graphs suffer from semantic deficiencies, including (1) insufficient modeling of collaborative signals among items and (2) structural distortions introduced by noise in raw modality features, ultimately compromising performance. To address these issues, we first extract collaborative signals from the interaction graph and infuse them into each modality-specific item semantic graph to enhance semantic modeling. Then, we design a modulus-based personalized embedding perturbation mechanism that injects perturbations with modulus-guided personalized intensity into embeddings to generate contrastive views. This enables the model to learn noise-robust representations through contrastive learning, thereby reducing the effect of structural noise in semantic graphs. Besides, we propose a dual representation alignment mechanism that first aligns multiple semantic representations via a designed Anchor-based InfoNCE loss using behavior representations as anchors, and then aligns behavior representations with the fused semantics by standard InfoNCE, to ensure representation consistency.

Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, combining graph queries with vector search offer promise but are typically static, rely on proprietary tools, and lack uncertainty estimates. We present an agentic approach that encapsulates the hybrid RAG pipeline within an autonomous agent capable of (1) dynamically selecting between GraphRAG and VectorRAG for each query, (2) adapting instruction-tuned generation in real time to researcher needs, and (3) quantifying uncertainty during inference. This dynamic orchestration improves relevance, reduces hallucinations, and promotes reproducibility.   Our pipeline ingests bibliometric open-access data from PubMed, arXiv, and Google Scholar APIs, builds a Neo4j citation-based knowledge graph (KG), and embeds full-text PDFs into a FAISS vector store (VS) using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. A Llama-3.3-70B agent selects GraphRAG (translating queries to Cypher for KG) or VectorRAG (combining sparse and dense retrieval with re-ranking). Instruction tuning refines domain-specific generation, and bootstrapped evaluation yields standard deviation for evaluation metrics.

Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts, exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However, text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs: multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting (DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts. Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.</details>|[2507.21653v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21653v1)| null|",

However, existing Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their inability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In this work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over temporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal ambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units (DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal anchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture temporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event graph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting efficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent generation, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that retrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time Chain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This unified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event sequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG systems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks demonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of three typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more faithful and temporal-aware generation.

Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and local information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods often suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between correct and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address this, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with dual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by segregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message passing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways, preventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination. In addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which partitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the candidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which alleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a 1.8$\\times$ acceleration in training efficiency.

Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex, a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs: natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations process.</details>|[2507.08443v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08443v1)| null|",

However, like all KG reasoning methods, rule learning suffers from a critical weakness-its dependence on the I.I.D. assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due to selection bias during training or agnostic distribution shifts during testing (e.g., as in query shift scenarios), ultimately undermining model performance and reliability. To enable robust KG reasoning in wild environments, this study investigates logical rule learning in the presence of agnostic test-time distribution shifts. We formally define this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG reasoning-a previously underexplored problem, and propose the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework as a solution. StableRule is an end-to-end framework that combines feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD generalization in KG reasoning. By leveraging feature decorrelation, StableRule mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD scenarios, improving the robustness of the rule learning network. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across diverse heterogeneous environments, highlighting its practical significance for real-world applications.</details>|[2507.05110v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05110v3)| null|",

While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness.

However, traditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge graphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or over-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring edges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational message passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a semantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy. Specifically, this strategy first evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its incident edges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most pertinent ones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is effectively fused with the central node's own representation using a multi-head attention aggregator to generate a semantically focused node message. In this manner, our model not only leverages the structure and features of edges within the knowledge graph but also more accurately captures and propagates the contextual information most relevant to the specific link prediction task, thereby effectively mitigating interference from irrelevant information.

Yet, prevailing methods, which rely on static scoring functions over learned embeddings, struggling to simultaneously capture rich semantic context and the dynamic nature of relations. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework, conceptualizing a relation as a dynamic evolutionary process governed by its static semantic environment. FMS operates in two stages: it first learns context-aware entity embeddings via a Semantic Context Learning module, and then models a dynamic flow between them using a Conditional Flow-Matching module. This learned flow dynamically modulates a base static score for the entity pair. By unifying context-rich static representations with a conditioned dynamic flow, FMS achieves a more comprehensive understanding of relational semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FMS establishes a new state of the art across both canonical knowledge graph completion tasks: relation prediction and entity prediction. On the standard relation prediction benchmark FB15k-237, FMS achieves a near-perfect MRR of 99.8\\% and Hits@1 of 99.7\\% using a mere 0.35M parameters, while also attaining a 99.9\\% MRR on WN18RR. Its dominance extends to entity prediction, where it secures a 25.2\\% relative MRR gain in the transductive setting and substantially outperforms all baselines in challenging inductive settings. By unifying a dynamic flow mechanism with rich static contexts, FMS offers a highly effective and parameter-efficient new paradigm for knowledge graph completion.

Despite significant efforts in this area, most existing methods primarily rely on prerequisite relationships, which present two major limitations: 1) Requiring prerequisite relationships between knowledge concepts, which are difficult to obtain due to the cost of expert annotation, hindering the application of current learning path recommendation methods. 2) Relying on a single, sequentially dependent knowledge structure based on prerequisite relationships implies that difficulties at any stage can cause learning blockages, which in turn disrupt subsequent learning processes.

Specifically, we introduce a knowledge concept structure graph generation module EDU-GraphRAG that adaptively constructs knowledge concept structure graphs for different educational datasets, significantly improving the generalizability of learning path recommendation methods. We then propose a Discrimination Learning-driven Reinforcement Learning (DLRL) module, which mitigates the issue of blocked learning paths, further enhancing the efficacy of learning path recommendations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also provides interpretable reasoning for the recommended learning paths.</details>|[2506.22303v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22303v2)| null|",

However, LLMs often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains. Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.

A structured KG containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations is built using LLM-assisted triple extraction based on a custom ontology. In our KG-RAG pipeline, the fine-tuned LLMs first retrieves relevant knowledge from KG, enabling more accurate and factually grounded responses. Evaluated by DeepSeek-V3 as a judge, the KG-enhanced system improves performance across five dimensions, with an average score increase of 2.26\\%, demonstrating superior factual accuracy and relevance. Integrated with Web platform and API, KG2QA delivers an efficient and interactive user experience.

It leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts, enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this, we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final generation.

However, existing CL-based TKGR methods still face two key limitations: (1) They usually one-sidedly reorganize individual historical facts, while overlooking the historical context essential for accurately understanding the historical semantics of these facts; (2) They preserve historical knowledge by simply replaying historical facts, while ignoring the potential conflicts between historical and emerging facts. In this paper, we propose a Deep Generative Adaptive Replay (DGAR) method, which can generate and adaptively replay historical entity distribution representations from the whole historical context. To address the first challenge, historical context prompts as sampling units are built to preserve the whole historical context information. To overcome the second challenge, a pre-trained diffusion model is adopted to generate the historical distribution. During the generation process, the common features between the historical and current distributions are enhanced under the guidance of the TKGR model. In addition, a layer-by-layer adaptive replay mechanism is designed to effectively integrate historical and current distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DGAR significantly outperforms baselines in reasoning and mitigating forgetting.</details>|[2506.04083v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04083v1)| null|",

Existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) models perform link prediction tasks in transductive or semi-inductive settings, which means the entities, relations, and temporal information in the test graph are fully or partially observed during training. Such reliance on seen elements during inference limits the models' ability to transfer to new domains and generalize to real-world scenarios. A central limitation is the difficulty in learning representations for entities, relations, and timestamps that are transferable and not tied to dataset-specific vocabularies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the first fully-inductive approach to temporal knowledge graph link prediction. Our model employs sinusoidal positional encodings to capture fine-grained temporal patterns and generates adaptive entity and relation representations using message passing conditioned on both local and global temporal contexts. Our model design is agnostic to temporal granularity and time span, effectively addressing temporal discrepancies across TKGs and facilitating time-aware structural information transfer. As a pretrained, scalable, and transferable model, POSTRA demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on unseen temporal knowledge graphs, effectively generalizing to novel entities, relations, and timestamps. Extensive theoretical analysis and empirical results show that a single pretrained model can improve zero-shot performance on various inductive temporal reasoning scenarios, marking a significant step toward a foundation model for temporal KGs.</details>|[2506.06367v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06367v1)| null|",

Tensor decomposition-based (TDB) models have demonstrated strong performance in KGC. In this paper, we provide a summary of existing TDB models and derive a general form for them, serving as a foundation for further exploration of TDB models. Despite the expressiveness of TDB models, they are prone to overfitting. Existing regularization methods merely minimize the norms of embeddings to regularize the model, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose a novel regularization method for TDB models that addresses this limitation. The regularization is applicable to most TDB models and ensures tractable computation. Our method minimizes the norms of intermediate variables involved in the different ways of computing the predicted tensor. To support our regularization method, we provide a theoretical analysis that proves its effect in promoting low trace norm of the predicted tensor to reduce overfitting.

Researchers have continuously explored various models. However, most previous efforts have neglected to take advantage of regularization from a deeper perspective and therefore have not been used to their full potential. This paper rethinks the application of regularization methods in KGC. Through extensive empirical studies on various KGC models, we find that carefully designed regularization not only alleviates overfitting and reduces variance but also enables these models to break through the upper bounds of their original performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sparse-regularization method that embeds the concept of rank-based selective sparsity into the KGC regularizer. The core idea is to selectively penalize those components with significant features in the embedding vector, thus effectively ignoring many components that contribute little and may only represent noise.

To mitigate hallucination, many systems use a knowledge graph to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG). However, the large amount of retrieved knowledge contexts increase these inference costs further. A promising solution to balance performance and cost is LLM routing, which directs simple queries to smaller LLMs and complex ones to larger LLMs. However, no dedicated routing methods currently exist for RAG, and existing training-based routers face challenges scaling to this domain due to the need for extensive training data.

While integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) provides access to structured, verifiable information, existing approaches often generate incomplete or factually inconsistent reasoning paths. To this end, we propose Self-Reflective Planning (SRP), a framework that synergizes LLMs with KGs through iterative, reference-guided reasoning. Specifically, given a question and topic entities, SRP first searches for references to guide planning and reflection. In the planning process, it checks initial relations and generates a reasoning path.

To bridge the standard GCL and pi-noise framework, we design a Gaussian auxiliary variable to convert the loss function to information entropy. We prove that the standard GCL with pre-defined augmentations is equivalent to estimate the beneficial noise via the point estimation. Following our analysis, PiNGDA is derived from learning the beneficial noise on both topology and attributes through a trainable noise generator for graph augmentations, instead of the simple estimation.

Conditioned on a query relation, a multi-head attention mechanism propagates information over the RDG to produce context-aware relation embeddings. These embeddings then guide a second GNN to perform inductive message passing over the original knowledge graph, enabling prediction on entirely new entities and relations. Comprehensive experiments on 60 benchmarks demonstrate that GraphOracle outperforms prior methods by up to 25% in fully-inductive and 28% in cross-domain scenarios. Our analysis further confirms that the compact RDG structure and attention-based propagation are key to efficient and accurate generalization.</details>|[2505.11125v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11125v2)| null|",

However, a common note always seems to follow: \"LLMs can make mistakes. Be careful with important info.\" This points to the reality that not all outputs from LLMs are dependable, and users must evaluate them manually. The challenge deepens as hallucinated responses, often presented with seemingly plausible explanations, create complications and raise trust issues among users. To tackle such issue, this paper proposes GE-Chat, a knowledge Graph enhanced retrieval-augmented generation framework to provide Evidence-based response generation. Specifically, when the user uploads a material document, a knowledge graph will be created, which helps construct a retrieval-augmented agent, enhancing the agent's responses with additional knowledge beyond its training corpus. Then we leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic generation, n-hop sub-graph searching, and entailment-based sentence generation to realize accurate evidence retrieval. We demonstrate that our method improves the existing models' performance in terms of identifying the exact evidence in a free-form context, providing a reliable way to examine the resources of LLM's conclusion and help with the judgment of the trustworthiness.</details>|[2505.10143v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10143v1)| null|",

Recently, learners have increasingly used Large Language Models (LLMs) to support them in acquiring new knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to hallucinations which limits their reliability. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving relevant documents before generating a response. However, the application of RAG across different MOOCs is limited by unstructured learning material. Furthermore, current RAG systems do not actively guide learners toward their learning needs. To address these challenges, we propose a Graph RAG pipeline that leverages Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) to guide learners to understand knowledge concepts in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. Specifically, we implement (1) a PKG-based Question Generation method to recommend personalized questions for learners in context, and (2) an EduKG-based Question Answering method that leverages the relationships between knowledge concepts in the EduKG to answer learner selected questions. To evaluate both methods, we conducted a study with 3 expert instructors on 3 different MOOCs in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. The results of the evaluation show the potential of Graph RAG to empower learners to understand new knowledge concepts in a personalized learning experience.</details>|[2505.10074v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10074v2)| null|",

The proposed approach overcomes limitations of existing methods by enabling fine-grained control over item difficulty, psychometric calibration, and cognitive alignment. It employs multi-graph isolation to preserve domain-specific semantics and leverages a distributed agent architecture coordinated through Data Distribution Service, abbreviated as DDS, for scalable and fault-tolerant operations. Each agent specializes in tasks such as retrieval, generation, or evaluation, forming a modular and traceable pipeline. Distinctively, the framework encodes semantic hierarchies, PageRank-based concept weighting, and assessment-theory parameters directly into the generation process, ensuring that questions are both contextually grounded and cognitively calibrated. Deployed at Taiwan's National Institute of Environmental Research, the system has demonstrated practical value by reducing manual workload, improving reliability and validity, and supporting both adaptive and standardized assessments.

In real-world KGs, although many entities exist, the relations exhibit a long-tail distribution, which can hinder information retrieval performance. Previous few-shot knowledge graph completion studies focused exclusively on the positive triple information that exists in the graph or, when negative triples were incorporated, used them merely as a signal to indicate incorrect triples. To overcome this limitation, we propose Relation-Based Conditional Diffusion with Attention Pooling (ReCDAP). First, negative triples are generated by randomly replacing the tail entity in the support set. By conditionally incorporating positive information in the KG and non-existent negative information into the diffusion process, the model separately estimates the latent distributions for positive and negative relations. Moreover, including an attention pooler enables the model to leverage the differences between positive and negative cases explicitly. Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Traditional register transfer level (RTL) design methods are manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors. While commercial (instruction-tuned) large language models (LLMs) shows promising performance for automation, they pose security and privacy concerns. Open-source models offer alternatives; however, they frequently fall short in quality/correctness, largely due to limited, high-quality RTL code data essential for effective training and generalization. This paper proposes RTL++, a first-of-its-kind LLM-assisted method for RTL code generation that utilizes graph representations of code structures to enhance the quality of generated code. By encoding RTL code into a textualized control flowgraphs (CFG) and data flow graphs (DFG), RTL++ captures the inherent hierarchy, dependencies, and relationships within the code. This structured graph-based approach enhances the context available to LLMs, enabling them to better understand and generate instructions. By focusing on data generation through graph representations, RTL++ addresses the limitations of previous approaches that rely solely on code and suffer from lack of diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that RTL++ outperforms state-of-the-art models fine-tuned for RTL generation, as evaluated using the VerilogEval benchmark's Pass@1/5/10 metric, as well as the RTLLM1.1 model, which highlight the effectiveness of graph-enhanced context in advancing the capabilities of LLM-assisted RTL code generation.</details>|[2505.13479v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13479v1)| null|",

However, in real-world applications, it is difficult to guarantee that computationally affordable paths exist toward all candidate entities. According to our observation, the prediction accuracy drops significantly when paths are absent. To make the proposed algorithm more stable against the missing path circumstances, we introduce soft reasoning paths. Concretely, a specific learnable latent path embedding is concatenated to each relation to help better model the characteristics of the corresponding paths. The combination of the relation and the corresponding learnable embedding is termed a soft path in our paper. By aligning the soft paths with the reasoning paths, a learnable embedding is guided to learn a generalized path representation of the corresponding relation. In addition, we introduce a hierarchical ranking strategy to make full use of information about the entity, relation, path, and soft path to help improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the model. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our algorithm outperforms the compared state-of-the-art algorithms by a notable margin.

This paper introduces the Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG), an ontology-driven framework designed to overcome these limitations by explicitly modeling the formal structure and diachronic nature of legal norms. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI systems.</details>|[2505.00039v5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00039v5)| null|",

Key limitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability (provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language models with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming these deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge graph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs with a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by connecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of corresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of text through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from an initial lexical graph. Subsequently, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an unsupervised node classification problem allowing for the optimization of information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts at significantly reduced lengths. An initial experimental evaluation of our approach on a healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses given a set of medical concepts as well as a series of clinical guideline literature, indicates its potential to optimize information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts while significantly reducing their lengths, which, in turn, may lead to reduced costs as well as more consistent and reliable LLM outputs.</details>|[2504.19667v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19667v3)| null|",

Standard evaluation metrics rely on the closed-world assumption, which penalizes models for correctly predicting missing triples, contradicting the fundamental goals of link prediction. These metrics often compress accuracy assessment into a single value, obscuring models' specific strengths and weaknesses. The prevailing evaluation protocol, link prediction, operates under the unrealistic assumption that an entity's properties, for which values are to be predicted, are known in advance. While alternative protocols such as property prediction, entity-pair ranking, and triple classification address some of these limitations, they remain underutilized. Moreover, commonly used datasets are either faulty or too small to reflect real-world data. Few studies examine the role of mediator nodes, which are essential for modeling n-ary relationships, or investigate model performance variation across domains.

These approaches struggle to efficiently capture the complex connections in real-world knowledge graphs, thereby limiting their overall performance. To address this issue, we propose a structure-aware multimodal Diffusion model for multimodal knowledge graph Completion (DiffusionCom). DiffusionCom innovatively approaches the problem from the perspective of generative models, modeling the association between the $(head, relation)$ pair and candidate tail entities as their joint probability distribution $p((head, relation), (tail))$, and framing the MKGC task as a process of gradually generating the joint probability distribution from noise. Furthermore, to fully leverage the structural information in MKGs, we propose Structure-MKGformer, an adaptive and structure-aware multimodal knowledge representation learning method, as the encoder for DiffusionCom. Structure-MKGformer captures rich structural information through a multimodal graph attention network (MGAT) and adaptively fuses it with entity representations, thereby enhancing the structural awareness of these representations. This design effectively addresses the limitations of existing MKGC methods, particularly those based on multimodal pre-trained models, in utilizing structural information. DiffusionCom is trained using both generative and discriminative losses for the generator, while the feature extractor is optimized exclusively with discriminative loss. This dual approach allows DiffusionCom to harness the strengths of both generative and discriminative models.

Typical methods in this branch map an input query (textual descriptions associated with an entity and a relation) and its candidate entities into feature vectors, respectively, and then maximize the probability of valid triples. These methods are gaining promising performance and increasing attention for the rapid development of large language models. According to the property of the language models, the more related and specific context information the input query provides, the more discriminative the resultant embedding will be. In this paper, through observation and validation, we find a neglected fact that the relation-aware neighbors of the head entities in queries could act as effective contexts for more precise link prediction. Driven by this finding, we propose a relation-aware anchor enhanced knowledge graph completion method (RAA-KGC). Specifically, in our method, to provide a reference of what might the target entity be like, we first generate anchor entities within the relation-aware neighborhood of the head entity. Then, by pulling the query embedding towards the neighborhoods of the anchors, it is tuned to be more discriminative for target entity matching. The results of our extensive experiments not only validate the efficacy of RAA-KGC but also reveal that by integrating our relation-aware anchor enhancement strategy, the performance of current leading methods can be notably enhanced without substantial modifications.</details>|[2504.06129v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06129v2)| null|",

However, current GraphRAG methods are primarily evaluated on and overly tailored for knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) benchmarks, which are biased towards a few specific question patterns and do not reflect the diversity of real-world questions. To better evaluate GraphRAG methods, we propose a complete four-class taxonomy to categorize the basic patterns of knowledge graph questions and use it to create PolyBench, a new GraphRAG benchmark encompassing a comprehensive set of graph questions. With the new benchmark, we find that existing GraphRAG methods fall short in effectiveness (i.e., quality of the generated answers) and/or efficiency (i.e., response time or token usage) because they adopt either a fixed graph traversal strategy or free-form exploration by LLMs for fact retrieval. However, different question patterns require distinct graph traversal strategies and context formation. To facilitate better retrieval, we propose PolyG, an adaptive GraphRAG approach by decomposing and categorizing the questions according to our proposed question taxonomy.

However, most real-world knowledge graphs are incomplete, which significantly degrades their performance on downstream tasks. Additionally, the relationships in real-world knowledge graphs often follow a long-tail distribution, meaning that most relations are represented by only a few training triplets. To address these challenges, few-shot learning has been introduced. Few-shot KG completion aims to make accurate predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a limited number of training triplets are available. Although many methods have been proposed, they typically learn each relation individually, overlooking the correlations between different tasks and the relevant information in previously trained tasks. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based few-shot KG completion method (TransNet). By learning the relationships between different tasks, TransNet effectively transfers knowledge from similar tasks to improve the current task's performance.

Traditional structure-based KGC methods, while effective, face significant computational demands and scalability challenges due to the need for dense embedding learning and scoring all entities in the KG for each prediction. Recent text-based approaches using language models like T5 and BERT have mitigated these issues by converting KG triples into text for reasoning. However, they often fail to fully utilize contextual information, focusing mainly on the neighborhood of the entity and neglecting the context of the relation. To address this issue, we propose KGC-ERC, a framework that integrates both types of context to enrich the input of generative language models and enhance their reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a sampling strategy to effectively select relevant context within input token constraints, which optimizes the utilization of contextual information and potentially improves model performance. Experiments on the Wikidata5M, Wiki27K, and FB15K-237-N datasets show that KGC-ERC outperforms or matches state-of-the-art baselines in predictive performance and scalability.</details>|[2503.23205v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23205v1)| null|",

Prior methods in cross-modal summarization have often suffered from high computational overheads and limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a \\textit{Cross-Modal State-Space Graph Reasoning} (\\textbf{CSS-GR}) framework that incorporates a state-space model with graph-based message passing, inspired by prior work on efficient state-space models. Unlike existing approaches relying on purely sequential models, our method constructs a graph that captures inter- and intra-modal relationships, allowing more holistic reasoning over both textual and visual streams. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves summarization quality and interpretability while maintaining computational efficiency, as validated on standard multimodal summarization benchmarks. We also provide a thorough ablation study to highlight the contributions of each component.</details>|[2503.20988v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20988v2)| null|",

To address these challenges, we propose DEMENTIA-PLAN, an innovative retrieval-augmented generation framework that leverages large language models to enhance conversational support. Our model employs a multiple knowledge graph architecture, integrating various dimensional knowledge representations including daily routine graphs and life memory graphs. Through this multi-graph architecture, DEMENTIA-PLAN comprehensively addresses both immediate care needs and facilitates deeper emotional resonance through personal memories, helping stabilize patient mood while providing reliable memory support. Our notable innovation is the self-reflection planning agent, which systematically coordinates knowledge retrieval and semantic integration across multiple knowledge graphs, while scoring retrieved content from daily routine and life memory graphs to dynamically adjust their retrieval weights for optimized response generation. DEMENTIA-PLAN represents a significant advancement in the clinical application of large language models for dementia care, bridging the gap between AI tools and caregivers interventions.</details>|[2503.20950v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20950v1)| null|",

This paper presents a novel approach within the model-free framework of reinforcement learning, aimed at optimizing power network operations without prior expert knowledge. We introduce a masked topological action space, enabling agents to explore diverse strategies for cost reduction while maintaining reliable service using the state logic as a guide for choosing proper actions. Through extensive experimentation across 20 different scenarios in a simulated 5-substation environment, we demonstrate that our approach achieves a consistent reduction in power losses, while ensuring grid stability against potential blackouts. The results underscore the effectiveness of combining dynamic observation formalization with opponent-based training, showing a viable way for autonomous management solutions in modern energy systems or even for building a foundational model for this field.</details>|[2503.20688v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20688v1)| null|",

By rigorously analyzing structural (Von Neumann graph entropy) and semantic (embedding) entropy, we identify a subtle yet robust regime in which semantic entropy persistently dominates over structural entropy. This interplay is quantified by a dimensionless Critical Discovery Parameter that stabilizes at a small negative value, indicating a consistent excess of semantic entropy. Empirically, we observe a stable fraction (12%) of \"surprising\" edges, links between semantically distant concepts, providing evidence of long-range or cross-domain connections that drive continuous innovation. Concomitantly, the system exhibits scale-free and small-world topological features, alongside a negative cross-correlation between structural and semantic measures, reinforcing the analogy to self-organized criticality. These results establish clear parallels with critical phenomena in physical, biological, and cognitive complex systems, revealing an entropy-based principle governing adaptability and continuous innovation. Crucially, semantic richness emerges as the underlying driver of sustained exploration, despite not being explicitly used by the reasoning process. Our findings provide interdisciplinary insights and practical strategies for engineering intelligent systems with intrinsic capacities for long-term discovery and adaptation, and offer insights into how model training strategies can be developed that reinforce critical discovery.</details>|[2503.18852v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18852v1)| null|"
